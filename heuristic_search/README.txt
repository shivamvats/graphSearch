Coding Standards
================

* Method/Function naming policy:
    - camelCase for all methods/functions.
    - exceptions:
        - virtual functions start with a capital letter.

* Public/Private policy:
    Nothing is private. Everything is public.

* Getter and Setters
    - set*() defines setters.
    - there are no setter methods. Directly access the member variables.
